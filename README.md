#Graphics Lab 2

##Overview:
This processing script performs the following operations on the "lab2.jpg" image:
    1. Displays the RGB channel values of the pixel underneath the mouse cursor.
    2. Allows the user to show only the r g or b channel by selecting the corresponding key on the keyboard. Any other key selection will result in displaying the original image.
  
##Assumptions:
   - Users will only use lower case letters for input
   - Any time a 'r', 'g', or 'b' key is pressed(once) the image channels will be processed once. Thus the alternate channel will be shown until a different channel is selected.
   - Once any other key is pressed the image will be returned to the original
